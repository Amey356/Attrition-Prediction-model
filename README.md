# Attrition Prediction Model

## Overview
This project builds an **Attrition Prediction Model** using **Logistic Regression** to analyze employee turnover. The goal is to identify key factors influencing attrition and help organizations make data-driven retention strategies.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing** â€“ Handling missing values and normalizing data.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** â€“ Understanding trends and key factors.
- **Feature Engineering** â€“ Selecting and transforming relevant features.
- **Class Balancing** â€“ Using techniques to address data imbalance.
- **Label Encoding** â€“ Converting categorical features into numerical form.
- **Model Evaluation** â€“ Analyzing model performance with accuracy, precision, recall, and classification reports.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas** â€“ Data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy** â€“ Numerical computations.
- **Scikit-learn** â€“ Machine learning algorithms.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** â€“ Data visualization.

## Results
- **Logistic Regression** helps predict employee attrition based on key features.
- Model performance is evaluated using various classification metrics.
- Insights gained can help businesses implement better retention strategies.
